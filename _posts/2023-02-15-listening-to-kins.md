*Listening, to Kins* is a performance of listening to 279 vultures. Seated on a chair, one
member from Hillside Projects actively listens to a wake of vultures’ tumultuous feast on a
carcass, a macabre yet tender act of eating and being eaten. The performance took place on
25 January 2023 at Jatayu vulture restaurant in Kawasoti.


*Listening, to Kins* explores the act of listening to the vultures as a way to find kinship. The
sounds from the feast: hissing, kicking and flapping are transcribed into words resulting in
onomatopoetic* subtitles accompanying the video - a narrative created by the vultures
themselves.


“*Listening in wild places, we are audience to conversations in a language not our own.*” -
Robin Wall Kimmerer
