Seated on a chair, a performer from HP listens to 279 vultures eating a dead buffalo carcass. The tumultuous act of eating and of being eaten is transcribed as words that phonetically imitate, resemble, or suggest the sound that they describe. 

The performance took place on 25 January 2023 at Jatayu Vulture Restaurant, a vulture conservation project located in Kawasoti, Nepal. from HP

T﻿his video was made possible through an artist residency at Jatayu Vulture Restaurant in Kawasoti, organised by photo.circle, a platform for photography based in Kathmandu founded in 2007.
