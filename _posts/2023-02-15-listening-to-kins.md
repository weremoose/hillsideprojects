Seated on a chair, a performer from HP listens to 279 vultures eating a dead buffalo carcass. The tumultuous act of eating and being eaten is transcribed as words that phonetically imitate, resemble, or suggest the sound they describe. The performance took place on 25 January 2023 at Jatayu Vulture Restaurant, a vulture conservation project located in Kawasoti, Nepal. 

This work was supported by the 2023 PhotoKTM5 Residency Programme organised by photo.circle, a platform for photography based in Kathmandu founded in 2007. The video was exhibited in Kathmandu as part of the fifth edition of PhotoKTM curated by NayanTara Gurung Kakshapati, Shristi Shrestha, Diwas Raja Kc, Prasiit Sthapit, Irina Giri, Shikhar Bhattarai.
