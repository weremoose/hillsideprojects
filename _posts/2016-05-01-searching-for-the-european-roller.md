You are unmistakable<br/>
Your deepest desires remain unknown<br/>
Last observed nesting in Sweden in 1967<br/>
You were spotted on a barren hilltop<br/>
Soon to forsake this land altogether

You fly across economical and country borders<br/>
Yet the reason for your disappearance is uncertain<br/>
Is it the operation of biocide biotopic changes<br/>
Or is cultural boredom the reason you left intolerant Europe?

Searching for the European Roller is a long-term research project that involves lecture performances, video and installation. Central to the project is the bird, The European Roller (in Swedish Blåkråka). A bird that used to live and breed in northern Europe but no longer does. The last time the bird was seen nesting in Sweden was in 1967 on the island of Fårö. Recently there has been several initiatives to get The European Roller back to Sweden. Landscapes have been chopped apart, re-arranged and designed specifically to lure the bird back. Why? Through mapping and exploring the whereabouts, emotions and migratory patterns of the bird the project has sought to understand the desire for the reintroduction of specifies and the construction of nature. Why are certain species more desirable than others? Who or what belongs where and who or what does not belong?
