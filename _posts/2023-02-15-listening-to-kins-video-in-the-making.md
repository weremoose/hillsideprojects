*The Scavenger Collapse* is a video in the making about the endangered vulture in India. Playfully experimenting with the format of a BBC educational video, the video will be narrated by two middle-aged white presenters. The video explores the consequences of a failed symbiosis between humans and more than humans and weaves it together with stories on eating, fascism, hierarchy, and death, as well as Britain's shameful colonisation of India\
\
This work is based on a previous ambulating lecture performance where Hillside Projects conducted a presentation with the aid of a cassette player, sandwich, drawings and found photographs for small groups in their offices, over zoom online and in homes.\
\
*The Scavenger Collapse* is made with the generous support through a project grant from Konstnärsnämnden (The Swedish Arts Grants Committee).
