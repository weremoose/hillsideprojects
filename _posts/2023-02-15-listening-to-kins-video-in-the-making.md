**The Scavenger Collapse** turns its gaze towards the declining vulture population in India and Nepal as it playfully employs the format of BBC educational videos. Following the original public service broadcasting remit “to inform, educate and entertain,” the video is narrated by a female presenter and male performer. It is accompanied by an 80s style soundtrack. 

This work explores the consequences of a failed symbiosis and weaves it together with stories of tilting democracies and Britain’s (shameful) colonisation of India, as well as turning the gaze on the presenters themselves.
