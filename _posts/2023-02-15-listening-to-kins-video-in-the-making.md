A video in the making that playfully experiments with the format of a BBC educational video to tell the story of a desperate search for something on the verge of disappearing. 

A white man travels southwards to find a bird, but during his voyage, he and the search begin to unravel. Accompanied by an 80s music-inspired soundtrack, a woman in a studio setting tells the story of the search, the bird, the man, and the following collapse. 

*The Scavenger Collapse* is made with the generous support through a project grant from Konstnärsnämnden (The Swedish Arts Grants Committee).
