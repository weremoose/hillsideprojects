##### 30-minute lecture performance including found slides, text, drawing, risographs, bird bones, map, video, text, music, speakers, microphone and sound.


Included in the larger research project _Searching for the European Roller_ is a number of lecture performances and presentations. The lectures and presentations explore the characteristic of the chosen format (the lecture performance) and are situated in a place between discourse and action, reflection and production, fact and imagination, spectacle and mythmaking. Responding to site and context in which the presentation takes place, the lecture takes on a slightly new format each time presented. It applies and appropriates traditional research methods whilst also slowly unraveling additional layers. In such it offers an alternative reading on the subject matter.

> _Searching for the European Roller_ is an artistic research enquiry that weaves in and out of the history of a disappearing blue bird and re-traces its memories and emotions. The project excavates the many layers surrounding the birdsâ€™ need for departure and the strong national desire for its return. In doing so, concepts of migration and belonging are connected to a larger political understanding of belonging.
