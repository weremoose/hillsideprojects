"Martha, Celia, Celia's baby, Benjamin, Kauai O'o, Toughie, Incas."

\-You were the last individuals of your kind, yet all extinct before you were born.

A video in the making that looks into notions of death and the act of mourning as a process of re-learning the world in times of extinction and loss. Set in a fictional forest landscape, it tells the stories of five individuals that were the last of their species, so-called endlings. Weaving in and out of a healing process and narratives of lived lives, the video offers a memorial to those lost.



The script to this video was written during an artist residency at Sfakiotes artist residency in Lefkada, Greece during the summer of 2019 with generous support from Helge Ax:sson Johnsons Stiftelse.
