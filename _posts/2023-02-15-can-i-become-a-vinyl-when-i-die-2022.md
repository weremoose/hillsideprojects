For several years, Hillside Projects have collected dust and feather residue from taxidermied European Roller birds stored in zoological collections across Sweden. The residue from the birds has then been pressed into bespoke vinyl records in an attempt to “listen” to the dead. The European Roller is a regionally extinct bird in Sweden, and was last seen nesting in the country in 1967. Transforming the findings from the birds into sound is a gesture to consider and listen to more than humans. This work is presented as a performance, appropriating the format of a “record release/listening session.”

T﻿he dust findings are pressed into ten unique vinyl records.
