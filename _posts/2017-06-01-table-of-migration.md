Found map, drawing and lecture performance.

A found political map from 1943. A map of previous borders, outdated names, historical trajectories and countries differentiated by bright colours. Presented pinned to the wall or wrapped around a table. 1943 in the south of Sweden: a small bird departed only to return on sporadic visits. The bird1 set off on a complex form of locomotion and headed south, past the Atlas Mountains moving towards warmer latitudes. Added to the map, during several lecture performances, are drawings and notes describing an emotional and physical flight. Accumulated over time are layers of histories, of movement, borders, emotions and displacement.
