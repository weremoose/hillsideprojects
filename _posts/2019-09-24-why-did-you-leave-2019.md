*Why Did You Leave?* is an installation that includes a publication, a corrugated fibreboard (wellpapp) table and a fabric map with text. The installation builds upon a previous body of work, *Searching For The European Roller*, 2015-2019,  a project that aims to trace the disappearance and whereabouts of a bird. The loose pages of the unbound publication are splayed out on the table, ephemeral in their presentation and creating an overlapping narrative through their many layers. The fabric map is stapled to the wall after having been used in a lecture performance at the beginning of the exhibition. The cardboard table is taken apart and recycled at the end of the exhibition.
