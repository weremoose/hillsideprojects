*The Magician and the Cauldron* consist of eight narratives that begin with “Magician” and end with “death”. Each narrative includes the same 19 words, but their compositions differ. The 19 words have been selected from Arundhati Roy’s text, *We Are Witnessing a Crime Against Humanity*, through an experimental process of reading, distilling, tracing, and repeating Roy’s words.

The eight texts hang on a painted backdrop that hints at a stage drape. Perhaps a stage for a magician, and where each narrative becomes a scene within a larger story.

This work was shown as part of the exhibition *dhak dhak ho-hum ah eekff iii ie* atRöda Sten Konsthall, 2022, curated by Amila Puzić & Mia Christersdotter Norman.
