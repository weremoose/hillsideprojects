[_Conditions of Sea_](http://lundsdomkyrka.se/2013/08/13/se-havet-i-domkyrkoforums-lanternin/) is a public video installation installed temporarily in a 4 Ã— 3 meter window at Domkyrkoforum, a building part of Lunds Cathedral. Shown during the evenings and at night, the video installation juxtaposes a silent view of an ocean within a public environment, thus attempting to create a tension between the conditionings of time, space and architecture. During one month, as viewers moved across the city square, they were met by a moving seascape placed within a city framework.
Presented as part of Lunds kulturnatt 2013 and conceived with the support from [Lunds Domkyrka](http://lundsdomkyrka.se), Lunds Kommun, BA Foto Lund and Filmcentrum Stockholm.
