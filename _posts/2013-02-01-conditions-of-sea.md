_<a href="http://lundsdomkyrka.se/2013/08/13/se-havet-i-domkyrkoforums-lanternin/" target="blank">Conditions of Sea</a>_ is a public video installation installed temporarily in a 4 Ã— 3 meter window at Domkyrkoforum, a building part of Lunds Cathedral. Shown during the evenings and at night, the video installation juxtaposes a silent view of an ocean within a public environment, thus attempting to create a tension between the conditionings of time, space and architecture. During one month, as viewers moved across the city square, they were met by a moving seascape placed within a city framework.

> Presented as part of Lunds kulturnatt 2013 and conceived with the support from <a href="http://lundsdomkyrka.se" target="blank">Lunds Domkyrka</a>, Lunds Kommun, BA Foto Lund and <a href="https://www.filmbasen.se/filmare/emily-mennerdahl" target="blank">Filmcentrum Stockholm</a>.
