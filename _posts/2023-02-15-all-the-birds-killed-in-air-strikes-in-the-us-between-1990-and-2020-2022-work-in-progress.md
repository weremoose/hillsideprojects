Since the 1990s, the FAA (Federal Aviation Agency) in the US has collected information on birds killed in collisions with aeroplanes. The FFA’s database covers all the states including information such as bird species, time, weather conditions and location of the crash. 

Through applying a system of translating words into musical notes, Hillside Projects are working towards transforming the birds’ deaths into music. This will in turn be played and performed by a band consisting of Hillside Projects and artist/musician Jonas Holmer.

A﻿s of yet five states have been translated into musical notes. It is a very time consuming task and many states remain to be translated.
