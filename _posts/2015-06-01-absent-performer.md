_The Absent Performer_ is an installation set up as a working space for Hillside Projects. Central to the installation is a video. The video mirrors the gallery set up, with all the elements being there, except for the performer. In the video the performer reads a manifest on the experience of belonging. The video loop is 6 minutes and includes music. On the table the visitor can also find objects relating to the video.
