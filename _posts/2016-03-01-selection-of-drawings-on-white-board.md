Included in several projects are a series of drawings and experiments on white-board. The drawings are presented as part of installations and used in lecture performances. Lines, contours, signs and writing are formed through an act of erasing. Through a slow process of covering parts or entire surfaces of white-board sheets with a marker pen an image then develops in a process where the surface is erased or removed. A process that could be likened or compared to a negative slowly developing or an etching technique.

> The images are taken in our studio and from the exhibition Looking for a Bird at <a href="http://idigalleri.org/2017/10/05/hillside-projects-emily-mennerdahl-jonas-bottern/" target="blank">ID:I Galleri</a>, Stockholm 2017.
