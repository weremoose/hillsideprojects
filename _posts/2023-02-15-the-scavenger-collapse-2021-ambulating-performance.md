This 30-minute lecture performance departs from the story of the Indian vulture and the consequences of a failed symbiosis. Socio-political narratives on death and hierarchies are woven together with stories about food, eating, and fascism told with the aid of a cassette player, live drawing, food, and mind maps.


The lecture performance is mobile, with a performer visiting homes, offices, galleries, and institutions, thus creating an intimate encounter between the performer and the audience (of no more than four people). 


T﻿his work was developed and first presented during an artist residency at SEA Foundation in Tilburg (NE) in early spring 2021 as a response to the restrictions of COVID lockdowns. Since then, it has continued to be performed in various locations.
