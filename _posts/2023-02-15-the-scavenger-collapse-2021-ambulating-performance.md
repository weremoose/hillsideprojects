*T﻿he Scavenger Collapse* is a performance lecture which departs from the history of the Indian vulture and a failed symbiosis. The story of the vulture is woven together with the many interconnected political layers through stories about food, hierarchies, fascism and death. The performance is mobile; a performer visits homes and offices, galleries, institutions, and individuals, as well as internationally through online platforms such as Zoom or Teams. It is intended to create an intimate encounter where the performer/lecturer guides the small audience (of no more than four people) through the story about the vulture with the aid of a narrated sound recording played on a cassette player , live drawing, photography, food and mind-maps.

T﻿his lecture was developed and first presented during an artist residency at SEA Foundation in Tilburg, NE early spring 2021. Photo credits: Rene van der Hulst
