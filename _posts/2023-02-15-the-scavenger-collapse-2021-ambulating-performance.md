A 30-minute lecture performance departing from the story of the Indian vulture and the consequences of a failed symbioses. Socio-political narratives on death and hierarchies are woven together with stories about food, eating and fascism and told the aid of a cassette player, live drawing, food and mind-maps.

The lecture performance is mobile and a performer visits homes and offices, galleries and institutions thus creating an intimate encounter between the performer and audience (of no more than four people). 

T﻿his work was developed and first presented in this format during an artist residency at SEA Foundation in Tilburg (NE) early spring 2021 as a response to the restrictions of COVID lockdowns.
