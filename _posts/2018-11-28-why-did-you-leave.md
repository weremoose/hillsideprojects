This is a publication made within the framework of _Searching for the European Roller_. Including archival material, photographs (both found and new), notes and thoughts, the publication begins its journey on Fårö in 1968 and continues through time and place toward southern latitudes in a search and understanding of a bird’s disappearance and departure.
