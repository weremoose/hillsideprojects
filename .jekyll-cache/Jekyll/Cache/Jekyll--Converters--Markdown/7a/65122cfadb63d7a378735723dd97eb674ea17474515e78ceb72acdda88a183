I"<p>A found political map from 1943. An image of previous borders, outdated names, historical trajectories and countries differentiated by bright colours. In 1943, in the south of Sweden, a small bird departed only to return on sporadic visits. The bird set off on a complex form of locomotion and headed south, past the Atlas Mountains moving towards warmer latitudes. Added to the map, are drawings and notes describing an emotional and physical flight. Over time are accumulations of histories, movement, borders, emotions and displacement, forming many layers of a narrative.</p>

<p>The found map has been manifested on both fabric and paper. Splayed on the floor, wrapped around a table or pinned to the wall it is used in lecture performances at the beginning of an exhibition. Drawings, text and notes describe the movement of the bird. The map then becomes a remnant of the lecture.</p>
