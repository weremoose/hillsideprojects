I"<p><em>Memorial for the Lost</em> is the second part in a video trilogy that attempts to explore the notion of extinction from different angles through i.e. existential politics, humour, grief, performative actions and rituals. Set in a fictional forest landscape, <em>Memorial for the Lost</em> tells the stories of six individual non-humans that were the last before extinction, so called “endlings”. Weaving in and out of a healing process and narratives of lived lives, the video offers an elegy to those lost.</p>
