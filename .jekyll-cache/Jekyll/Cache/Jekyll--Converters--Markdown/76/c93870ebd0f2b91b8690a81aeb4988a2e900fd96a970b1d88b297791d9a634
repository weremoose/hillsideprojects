I"ß<p>When you walk with Hillside Projects you walk slowly, fast, in silence, in conversation, as meditation, next to the path, with closed eyes, in action, as exercise, as art, in search, backwards, forwards and with eyes wide open.</p>

<p>This specific walk took place in March 2021 in Kristianstad kommun as part of the project: Sk√•neleden Konst - In Motion together with Kristianstad Konsthall. The three hour walk was aimed at a group of teenagers and involved re-interpretations of existing land art projects/performances, the making of a cyanotype flag with the aid of the local lake, an open field installation, actions and reactions and walking.</p>
