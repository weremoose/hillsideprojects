I"‹<p>In 2014-2015, Hillside Projects set out to create a catalogue of all the taxidermic European Rollers found across Sweden. Together with researchers at zoological institutions, the aim was to create an understanding of each bird, both physically and mentally. Dust and feathers were collected from the wings of the birds and presented within glass slides accompanied by text.  Each slide becomes an interpretation and representation of the individual birds physical and mental condition.</p>
