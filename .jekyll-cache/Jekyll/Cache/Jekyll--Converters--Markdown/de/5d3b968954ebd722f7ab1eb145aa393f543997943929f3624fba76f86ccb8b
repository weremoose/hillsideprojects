I"i<p><em><a href="http://lundsdomkyrka.se/2013/08/13/se-havet-i-domkyrkoforums-lanternin/" target="blank">Conditions of Sea</a></em> is a public video installation installed temporarily in a 4 Ã— 3 meter window at Domkyrkoforum, a building part of Lunds Cathedral. Shown during the evenings and at night, the video installation juxtaposes a silent view of an ocean within a public environment, thus attempting to create a tension between the conditionings of time, space and architecture. During one month, as viewers moved across the city square, they were met by a moving seascape placed within a city framework.</p>
