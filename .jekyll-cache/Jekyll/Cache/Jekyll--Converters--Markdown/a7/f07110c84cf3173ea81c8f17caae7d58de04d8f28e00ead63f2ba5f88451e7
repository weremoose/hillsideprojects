I"Ž<p>Included in the projectÂ <em>Searching for the European Roller</em><sup>[1]</sup>Â is a number of lecture performances and presentations. The lectures and presentations explore the characteristic of the chosen format (the lecture performance) and are situated in a place between discourse and action, reflection and production, fact and imagination, spectacle and mythmaking. Responding to site and context in which the presentation takes place, the lecture takes on a slightly new format each time presented. It applies and appropriates traditional research methods whilst also slowly unraveling additional layers. In such it hopes to offer an alternative reading on the subject matter.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><sup>[1]</sup><em>Searching for the European Roller</em> is an enquiry that weaves in and out of the history of a disappearing blue bird and re-traces its memories and emotions. The project excavates the many layers surrounding the birdsâ€™ need for departure and the strong national desire for its return. In doing so, concepts of migration and belonging are connected to a larger political understanding of belonging.</p>
