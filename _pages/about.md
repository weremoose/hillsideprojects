HP (Hillside Projects) is a transdisciplinary artistic entity founded in 2011 by Emily Berry Mennerdahl and Jonas Böttern. HP is based in Stockholm, Sweden. 

Within a conceptual framework, HP explores the many cycles of life in relation to place alongside the interconnected socio-political narratives that arise through these explorations. HP embraces the absurd and the comedic as intrinsic elements of the tragic. 

HP works in performance, video, sound, text, photography and painting. HP thrives from collaborations, not only within its own entity but also with others, and at times, it delves into curatorial spurs and community-based projects. HP considers how it moves in this world, what it brings into it, and why and how.

HP explores the notion of an audience. An audience in movement, an audience that is not alive, an intimate audience, a large audience, and one that is not present. HP asks what an audience is and what it can be. 

HP tells stories. Stories of place and stories of collapse. The main characters are often birds. Colourful birds on the brink of extinction, birds killed in aeroplane crashes, birds that eat the dead. In their making, these stories expand into larger narratives. Narratives about the life cycles, of being eaten and eating, and of dust. We are all stardust.

HP explores translation. Translating one matter into another. Translating text into music. And sound into text. Research into performance. And movement into solidness. HP reflects on the need for materiality or a dispense with materiality. HP aims to make exhibitions that fit into a large suitcase. Unravelling the small into the large. Transforming the ephemeral into something and something into nothing.
