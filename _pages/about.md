HP (Hillside Projects) is Emily Berry Mennerdahl and Jonas Böttern. HP tells stories. Stories about the many cycles of life and failed symbiosis. Birds are often the main characters: colourful birds on the brink of extinction, birds killed in aeroplane crashes, and birds that eat the dead. HP thinks about how to tell stories and which stories are who’s to tell. Embracing the absurd, comedic and tragic, tales of disappearances are explored, alongside the inter-related existential emotions and socio-political narratives that arise through these tales. HP’s works are manifested as performance, text, video, sound, painting and installations.
