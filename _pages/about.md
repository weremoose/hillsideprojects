Hillside Projects is an artistic collaboration between Emily Berry Mennerdahl and Jonas Böttern, they are currently based in Stockholm, Sweden. Hillside Projects multidisciplinary works are manifested as video, installation and performance. Prompted by current events in and around nature, Hillside Projects use methods of storytelling and performative actions to talk about the histories of and between humans and non-humans and explore notions of hope, despair, remorse and appease. Situated between the projections of the future and the archaeology of the past they aim to create works that ask:



Who or what belongs where? 

Who decides who or what belongs where? 

Who should be saved?
