Hillside Projects is an artistic collaboration between Emily Berry Mennerdahl and Jonas Böttern, currently based in Stockholm, Sweden. Hillside Projects multidisciplinary works are manifested as video, installation and performance. Prompted by current events in and around nature, Hillside Projects apply methods of storytelling and performative actions to talk about the histories of and between humans and non-humans whilst exploring notions of hope, despair, remorse and appease. Situating themselves somewhere between the projections of the future and the archaeology of the past they continue to explore:

Who or what belongs where? 

Who decides who or what belongs where? 

Who should be saved? or should we be saved?
