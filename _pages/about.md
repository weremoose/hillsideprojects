Hillside Projects (Emily Berry Mennerdahl & Jonas Böttern) is an artist duo based in Stockholm, Sweden. Through methods of storytelling and performance, their work is manifested as installations including text, videos and publications. Situated within a conceptual framework, their practice revolves around an exploration into tales of disappearances in the natural world, as well as the interrelated socio-political narratives that arise through these tales. Hillside Projects approach their subject matter embracing the absurd, the comedic and the tragic. 

Who should be saved and why? Who decides who should be saved? Is it time to say goodbye?
