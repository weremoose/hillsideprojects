Hillside Projects is a collaborative research and production group based in Stockholm, formed by Emily Mennerdahl and Jonas Böttern. Hillside Projects work interdisciplinary, always trying to dismantle and re-consider facts and knowledge. The group reflects upon methods of collecting, ordering, layering and presenting information and research material. Performative strategies, storytelling, collaboration and artistic research are important components of their practice. The works are manifested through drawing, photography, lecture performances, installations and video. Hillside Projects are committed to working in dialogue with other thinkers and professionals from a variety of fields.
