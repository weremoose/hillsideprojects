Hillside Projects is an artist duo consisting of Emily Berry Mennerdahl & Jonas Böttern. Their multidisciplinary practice is manifested as installations and performances including video, text, drawing and artist publications. Prompted by current events in and around nature, they apply methods of storytelling and performative actions in a desire to talk about the stories of and between humans and non-humans, as well as notions of hope and despair, remorse and guilt. Living in the sixth mass extinction, the on-going extinction event of species, mainly as an event of human activity, Hillside Projects attempt to relay the tragedies, comedies and stories of the natural world and its inhabitants. 

Who or what belongs where? 

Who decides who or what belongs where? 

Who should be saved?

Single inquiries into the lives of disappearing birds, the re-introduction of species, commemorations to the lost and details from on-going extinctions are presented in a variety of formats and situations. Videos, lecture performances, public presentations and publications become intertwined and offer details from a larger story on ecological exploitation.



Hillside Projects was formed during a longer trip to India in 2011. Residing on the top of a hill in a small village in the south of India, daily excursions evolved into larger projects. Travel, movement and exchange have always been important elements of both artists and continues to be so within the collaboration. Taking part in artist residencies, learning of alternative healing processes and daily yoga practice continue to inspire their work. Hillside Projects are currently based in Stockholm. Their videos are distributed by [FilmForm](https://www.filmform.com/artists/13264-hillside-projects-artist-group/) and [Vidéograph](https://www.videographe.org/en/)e. They are board members of [ID:I Galleri ](http://idigalleri.org/)in Stockholm and Jonas is also a board member of[ NKF](http://www.nkfsweden.org/information/about-nordic-art-association) (Nordic Art Association).
